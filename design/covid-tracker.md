# COVID-19 Tracker

## Tasks

1. Choosing a problem domain and solution
2. Identifying a user community and creating a persona
3. Writing a scenario
4. Creating a cultural probe
5. Divising global navigation

### Problem Domain and Solution

- **Problem Domain:** Make COVID-19 data exploration fun and accessible for all ages. Eventually, make it accessible for people with screen disabilities.

- **Solution:** An interactive website that is viewable on the internet through a desktop computer. Eventually, to be viewed on mobile.

### User Community and Personas

- **User Community:** The general public, people with access to the internet, people with a general interest in learning about COVID-19.

- **Personas:**
  1. Anne, a 12-year-old female who has been around the internet and phones all her life and is quite tech savvy. She prefers using a mobile phone and gets bored quickly of the things she looks at.
  2. Brandan, a 16-year-old male who has slight color blindness who prefers to use a web browser. If something catches his interest, he will go deep into learning more about it.
  3. Claire, a 45-year-old female who has corrective glasses and tends to stay up late looking at her phone. Her knowledge of public health is learned from what she hears in the news, but will be interested in learning more about something if a link is shared in social media.
  4. Daniel, a 46-year-old male who has carpal tunnel. He prefers to be more outdoors and less interested in public health, but if it concerns his family, will learn enough to help guide and protect them.

### Cultural Probe

- **Key issues of problem domain and solution:** The key issue of this problem domain is to select the right data set to represent and to define what data visualization would be appropriate to use so that users will be engaged but also find it informative.

- **Relate those to your persona. What needs do they have in this setting? What are the behaviors you are addressing?** Their needs are what their internet access is and whether it's a topic of interest to them. Also, if they've had bad experiences from COVID-19, they might not be interested in the product.

- **Describe your research questions:** What motivates you to learn about diseases like COVID-19? What kind of interactions do you like to use? What keeps your interest in using an educational/informational website? What kind of data visualizations are interesting to you?

- **What needs to go into a cultural probe kit to answer these questions? What activities?** Some graphics of COVID-19. Some graphics of different kinds of data visualizations. Some examples of animations that are interesting.

### Scenarios

- **Key issues of the problem domain and solution:**

  - Not everyone may have access to a device to access the internet.
  - Not everyone may have up-to-date technology to access the COVID-19 tracker.
  - Not everyone may understand how the interactions.
  - Not everyone may understand how to read the data, graphs and charts.
  - Not everyone may understand the importance of the data.
  - Not everyone may find the application interesting.

- **Relate those to the personas. What needs do they have in this setting? What behaviors are they addressing?**

  - Anne: Although Anne may not understand the data, she may find interest in the data visualizations if they are new to her, but may quickly get bored and move on to something else if the app is not interesting.
  - Brandan: Brandan was tasked to find information about COVID-19 for his science class and has some basic knowledge of diseases. He likes when informational things are gamified since he likes to play video games. Also, if the colors are hard for him to understand, he may not enjoy the experience due to his color blindness.
  - Claire: Claire doesn't have much patience with slow loading times. She also doesn't always have time to use the internet throughout the day with her full-time job and caring for the children, so she will usually be on her phone at night. If the website has a white background, she may not use it for very long since white is very straining to read at night.
  - Daniel: Daniel might have the least interest since he is more interested in things in the physical world. He would more likely view the tracker if COVID-19 more closely affects his family.

  - **What needs to go in the cultural probe kit:**
    - Camera with an activity to ask the user to take a photo of their preferred internet devices.
    - A newspaper of recent events related to COVID-19.
    - Add some guidance on what the data is telling us, how to read charts and graphs.
    - See if a tutorial may be helpful to draw in the user.
    - Add a color palette survey to assess which colors the users can read best. Account for 1) no color blindness, 2) red color blindness, 3) green color blindness, etc.
