          <Paragraph>I like to say that I grew up with the Internet.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>I started creating websites in 1999 in grade school. Those were the days of dial-up, <Link href={links.dhtml}>DHTML</Link> and life before social networks existed - it was a magical, neverending frontier.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>While discovering my career path, I studied Public Health where I used <Link href={links.r}>R</Link> to visualize <Link href={links.epidemiology}>epidemiology</Link> and statistics. I took <Link href={links.hci}>Human Computer Interaction</Link> on a whim and realized my love for creating on the internet was still there.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>I was later accepted to a computer science graduate program where I enjoyed studying <Link href={links.graphtheory}>graph theory</Link>, <Link href={links.computation}>theory of computation</Link> and advanced software processes.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>After all the code I wrote, I realized that the common denominator was creating data visualizations.</Paragraph>
          <Paragraph>These days, I am a UI Engineer based in San Francisco where I enjoy the challenge of taking arbitrary ideas and transforming them into beautiful and functional data visualizations.</Paragraph>
